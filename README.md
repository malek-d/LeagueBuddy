# LeagueBuddy
Context
League of Legends is a diverse PC video game with a continuously growing community of 27 million
players who are clocking in an approximate of 67 million monthly “matches” worldwide. The 2017
world championship for League of Legends spanning from late September till mid November saw a
total of 4 294 967 295 total hours viewership. With such an expansive game and so much data to sift
through, Riot Games, the creators of League provide an extensive array of API’s for developers to
create fan-made projects tailored to their wants and needs.
League Buddy is a companion like Android application that provides the functionality of viewing your
own league statistics, recent matches, ranked information and more. The app will provide users with
a fun and unique experience to track their League information in a portable mobile environment.

APIs
League of Legends API – Main api to be used in this project. League api will be sole provider of all
data generated and provided to the League buddy application.
Firebase API – No-SQL storage cloud system used to save user preferences, settings and favourites
Google AdSense – Api used to generate ads on the application
Targeted Audience
The audience targeted for this application would be the League of Legends players who utilise
android devices. The reasoning for this targeting is that the application is only available on android
platforms and is most relevant to casual/hardcore players of the League of Legends community.
